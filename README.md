# Recipe_Recommendation
 I created a recipe recommendation system that suggests dishes based on users' dietary preferences and available ingredients. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to match recipes from a dataset by nutritional fit and ingredient constraints, ranking recommendations by relevance to help users make healthy choices and reduce food waste.
